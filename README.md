I'm Yohanes Mulugeta. I'm a biomedical engineering graduate but during my studies I was introduced to programming which I now submerged to it. I'm now good at web development specially on frontend with a good skills on JavaScript, CSS HTML, MYSQL and php. I'm also good at macihne learning specifically using PyTorch. My undergraduate thesis was on pneumonia detection using transfer learning algorithms on PyTorch including a good web app for deploying the project.
